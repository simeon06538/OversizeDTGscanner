Barcode Scanner MVP
Barcode is scanned and the CSV is parsed, inkbay customization ID is compared with the input from the barcode. Once both match, the image url from the same row in the CSV is saved and displayed.

Had to do some last minute stuff because I realized that an exact path wouldn't work on other machines, and a relative path would make more sense.
