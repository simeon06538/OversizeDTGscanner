Barcode Scanner MVP
Barcode is scanned and the CSV is parsed, inkbay customization ID is compared with the input from the barcode. Once both match, the image url from the same row in the CSV is saved and displayed.

The barcode pdf has some barcode's that I generated online that match the order examples, and I turned my script into an application just to make it easier to run. 

Had to do some last minute stuff because I realized that an exact path wouldn't work on other machines, and a relative path would make more sense.
